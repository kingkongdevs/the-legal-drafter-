                            The breakdown of a relationship can be hell. Feeling like you can't agree on anything,
                            fighting over insignificant details, stressful days and sleepless nights - the entire
                            process can be a nightmare. So when you do agree to terms, you want to settle ASAP so you
                            can finally move on. That's where I can help.

                            <strong> My name is Melita Lloyd</strong> - I'm a legal drafter and lawyer who specialises
                            in preparing rapid Consent Orders for couples who have verbally agreed to terms. If you want
                            to save $1,000s on greedy lawyer fees, settle your agreement FAST (before someone changes
                            their mind), and finally move on with your life, you've come to the right person.

                    <p>If you want to get your agreement settled quickly, you must ensure your Consent Orders are properly prepared. Too many couples take the DIY route with disastrous results. They write terms that aren’t legally enforceable, the courts reject their settlement, and they’re forced to start over with a blank page!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have 10+ years’ experience in family law and have prepared almost 1,000 Consent Orders. I can put your agreement into legally-enforceable terms and file it with the courts inside 24 hours. You’ll have peace of mind moving forward and be able to transition to the next stage of your life as soon as possible.

                                            illustrated manuals that cover among other topics, forex markets, charting,

                                            Prior to Meeting Ron and joining the LIFT trading community I had a little
                                            bit of prior trading knowledge. I was looking to avoid the 40 years of a 9-5
                                            job ahead of me. <br>

                                                I didn't know how to go about this until I joined the LIFT
                                                community and implemented the LIFT trading strategies to boost my
                                                trading
                                                success. At the moment I have left my job and am Live trading and
                                                working to
                                                grow my income.
                                                I would recommend LIFT because it gives the structure and strategies
                                                needed
                                                to be successful trading forex.

                                            I spent decades and thousands of dollars looking for a "better way" to earn
                                            a living. My financial goals have always been modest, because I was seeking
                                            personal freedom and independence. After running with several different
                                            options over the years, I found that either the promised support was absent,
                                            or the type and level of activity required was beyond my capacity.

                                                The Trading Coach promised a couple of things upfront:-

                                                1. It will take real work to succeed in this business and it will not
                                                happen
                                                overnight.
                                                2. We will support you every step of the way and tell you what you need
                                                to
                                                hear in order to progress, and not necessarily what you want to hear.

                                                When I found The Trading Coach, I was feeling desperate for an
                                                alternative
                                                due to my personal circumstances and declining physical health. After
                                                joining, life only got harder and resulted in a nervous breakdown. I
                                                felt
                                                totally helpless and hopeless, and genuinely feared for my future.

                                                During my crises The Trading Coach was by my side, providing coaching
                                                relevant to my circumstances, and not once was I judged or questioned on
                                                my
                                                commitment. Because Ron and Ives (The Trading Coach) have created a
                                                community for the members, we get to share in each others success and
                                                learn
                                                from each others challenges. Had I not seen people that I knew, progress
                                                to
                                                earning a consistently profitable, full time income, I would have walked
                                                away thinking that it was not achievable. Several years on, I have
                                                recovered
                                                sufficiently to put in the time on the charts and training sessions.
                                                Still
                                                receiving coaching relevant to my level of knowledge and activity. Now I
                                                also am progressing in my pursuit of financial freedom. Today, I feel
                                                encouraged by the future and what it might look like.

                                                This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. It requires focused, consistent,
                                                and
                                                dedicated effort to get the results. Not only will you have the
                                                unwavering
                                                support of The Trading Coach, you will also have the support of the

                                                Ron and Ives, thank-you for your outstanding support and guidance. You

                                            workshops and LIFT zone meetings which have taught me so much about Forex
                                            trading and how to make money as a Forex trader.

                                            approach works.. you have like minded people you can chat with and as a
                                            community we are supporting one another.

                                                further clarification on anything the community is able to assist you
                                                too.

                                                There are several regularly run activities to assist you where you are
                                                at
                                                with your progress, so you can learn at your own pace.
                                                There are structures to use to help you stay on track, overcome the
                                                challenges in your mindset, and the coaching is 'one on one' when you
                                                request it, and it works!
                                                I cannot find any fault with the LIFT program and would recommend it to
                                                anyone who is serious and willing to learn to trade FORex to become
                                                financially independent.

                                            second year as an Apprentice Lift trader at step 4 and have never looked
                                            back. The support and community here is nothing short of amazing. The
                                            ongoing training and coaching is above and beyond anything else. If you are
                                            looking to start trading Forex, Look no further.
